# Using Genome Browsers to visualise high-throughput data

## Description 
Modern genomics technologies are able to produce large volumes of data that often leave researchers feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to begin the process of biological interpretation. In this course, we explain the common file formats generated by sequencing technologies and how they can be manipulated and explored by non-Bioinformaticians. The principal tools that we will use are the [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) and [University of Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser](https://www.genome.ucsc.edu/)

This event is part of a series of training courses organized in collaboration with Dr. Mark Dunning at [CRUK Cambridge Institute](http://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/). The materials for the course were developed in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Carroll, [MRC CSC](http://bioinformatics.csc.mrc.ac.uk/).

## Target audience
Graduate students, Postdocs and Staff members from the University of Cambridge, Affiliated Institutions and other external Institutions or individuals

## Duration
